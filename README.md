# Electricity-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Predicting the hourly electricity prices in Spain trying 9 different machine learning techniques with time series analysis and different splits and comparing the performance of different prediction algorithms to implement the best model
Algorithms Used:
1. Linear Regrssion Baseline
2. Ridge Linear Regression
3. Lasso Linear Regression
4. Random Forest
5. SVR
6. Decision Tree
7. Gradient Boosted Tree
8. XGBoost
9. ARIMA

These algorithms weer tried with different splitting techniques such as Random Split, Time-Series Split (Increasing window), Blocked Time-Series Split (Sliding Window)
